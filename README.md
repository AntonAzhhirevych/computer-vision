## Branches

Each branch in this repository represents a standalone project focused on a specific topic within computer vision, object detection, or graphical rendering.

### `01-basic-graphics-python`

**Exploring the Basic Graphical Capabilities of Python**

This branch demonstrates how to create layered 2D shapes, render symmetrical logo-like figures using triangles, and visualize mathematical signals. The project is built entirely with native Python libraries like `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `math`, making it ideal for understanding fundamental graphical operations without using external engines.

### `02-coordinate-transformations-2d-3d`

**Study of Coordinate Construction and Transformations for 2D and 3D Objects**

This branch focuses on the creation and transformation of 2D and 3D geometric objects using homogeneous coordinates and transformation matrices. It includes an animated 3D triangular-based pyramid with real-time rotation, color interpolation, and opacity blendingâ€”providing insight into practical 3D graphics implementation with `matplotlib` and `numpy`.
